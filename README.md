# **StyleU - Fashion E-commerce Website** ✨👗

**Tagline:** *Where Style Meets Elegance* 💫

## **Introduction**
**StyleU** is a fashion e-commerce platform that allows users to browse, purchase, and explore a wide range of clothing and accessories. This project showcases my journey in building a full-fledged e-commerce website, including both frontend and backend development, integrated with **MongoDB** for efficient data storage. 🛍️

## **Project Overview**

### **Step-by-Step Development Process** 🚀

#### **Frontend Development with React.js and Vite** 🖥️
- Started by building the frontend using **React.js**, with a focus on creating a seamless user experience. I chose **Vite** as my build tool to enhance the development speed and performance. ⚡
- Developed pages like **Login/Signup**, **Product Listings**, and **Product Details**. These pages are responsive and provide an intuitive interface for users to navigate. 📱
- Implemented frontend routing with **React Router** to enable smooth transitions between different pages. 🔄

#### **Backend Development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB** 💻
- For the backend, I used **Node.js** and **Express.js** to set up a RESTful API that serves as the backbone for handling requests such as **user authentication**, **product management**, and **order processing**. 🏗️
- Integrated **MongoDB** as the database for storing **product details**, **user information**, and **order history**. 🗄️
- Created routes for various functionalities, including **adding products**, **updating products**, **removing products**, and viewing **new collections**. 📦
- Utilized **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can access certain resources. 🔐

#### **User Authentication** 🔒
- Implemented **user authentication** with **JWT** for login and signup functionality. This allows users to securely access their accounts and make purchases. 🛒
- Used **bcrypt.js** for password hashing to enhance security. 🛡️

#### **API Routes and CRUD Operations** 🛠️
- Developed several **REST API** routes to support the core functionalities of the platform, such as:
  - **/api/auth/signup** for user registration
  - **/api/auth/login** for user login and generating authentication tokens
  - **/api/products/** for CRUD operations on products (**add**, **update**, **delete**, **view all**)

#### **Deployment** 🌐
- The project is hosted on **GitHub**, with the frontend and backend repositories separately managed. I used **Git** for version control to track the progress and changes made to the project. 📂
- The backend API is deployed locally during development, and I plan to deploy it on a cloud service such as **Heroku** or **AWS**. ☁️
